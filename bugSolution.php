The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) to ensure that the result of `strpos()` is numerically and type-wise equal to 0.

```php
$haystack = "This is a test string";
$needle = "Test";
if (strpos($haystack, $needle) === 0) {
    echo "Needle found at the beginning!";
} else {
    echo "Needle not found at the beginning.";
}
```

This corrected code will accurately report whether the needle is found at the very beginning of the string.
